# Problem statement

Develop a web platform with integrated IDE to help people learn programming and software development. The Project tries to solve the problem by providing two main interfaces. 

1. A programming interface:
This interface offers a simple editor, an area where the user can enter program input variables, and finally, the user can see the result of his code as it is running.

1. IDE interface:
This interface is more complex since it offers a real IDE to the user where he can develop complex software using VS code editor.

## Goals

- Help students and any person who wants to learn programming and software development, by providing tutorials that they can follow directly from the website.
- Provide a way to enterprises to create a simple project development test project to help them in their hiring process

## Non-goals

In the first iteration of the platform, we donâ€™t expect it to have real-time communication capabilities.

# Proposed solution

Microservice applications and intensive connection to cloud providers to be able to create High performant environment for the users.

### Implementations

The project is implemented using the following programming languages.

- Java (Spring boot/Quakus): Java will primarily be used to implement the backend of the platform.
- Typescript(NextJs): Typescript will be used for the application frontend as well as for the **agent** that will be used on the virtual machine to communicate with the rest of the external world (main backend and frontend).

Repository organization.

Because the main goal of this project is to learn as many technologies as possible, it will be organized as follow.

1. The application will be a mono repo. Instead of having a repository for each repository, we will use a single mono repo making it easy to share code and avoid duplication. Moreover, the mono repo approach also allows us to normalize configuration and easily adopt the same standard for each service. 
2. We will have two main application parts: 
    1. A backend part that will have multiple services,  which will be managed by G**[radle](https://blog.softwaremill.com/monorepo-with-gradle-b000d7b58eef)**
    2. A Frontend part that will also have multiple services, which will be managed by **[turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)** 

 

```jsx
we.learning:
|- backend
|----user management service
|----resource management service
|----billing service
|----build.gradle

|- frontend
|----webapp
|----welet
|----[turborepo specific config]
```

### We.learning components

### Welet

This component is a simple agent that is installed on all VM provided to the user. The main goal of this component is to be able to control as much as possible the VM the user will use without having to send too many requests to the **resource management service**

The **Welet** is implemented using typescript and **trpc**.
